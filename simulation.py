BVPBoundaryCondition, which implements boundary conditions and is responsible for updating the vector of function 
values at the edges after each time-step.

BVPDescriptor, which describes a Boundary Value Problem in an abstract mathematical sense. It does not concern itself
with vectors of function values, but it does provide functions to handle them. Contains information about the partial
differential equation as well as the boundary conditions through a BVPBoundaryCondition

BVPSimulation, which take a BVPDescriptor and actually makes a concrete instance of a numerical solution to the problem,
complete with coordinates and functions to update the state of the simulation.

There is also a function sim_and_plot which takes a BVPSimulation and renders the solution in realtime as it is solved.
